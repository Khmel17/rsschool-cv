## About me
### I am sociable, responsible, purposeful. I like an active type of recreation (kayaks, rides, skydiving).  I want and love to travel a lot (the sights of every city where I have been - to the very heart), I walk a lot and I adore trying national dishes from different countries of the world. I listen to music loudly (I attend music quizzes), I like painting by numbers, I read books (ranging from authentic literature by Gabriel Garcia Marquez and other Latin American writers, ending with  comics) and just enjoy life.
